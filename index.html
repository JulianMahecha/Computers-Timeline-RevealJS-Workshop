        <p><small>The computer was born not for entertainment or email but out of a need to solve a serious
            number-crunching crisis. By 1880, the U.S. population had grown so large that it took more than seven years
            to tabulate the U.S. Census results. The government sought a faster way to get the job done, giving rise to
            punch-card based computers that took up entire rooms.

            Today, we carry more computing power on our smartphones than was available in these early models. The
            following brief history of computing is a timeline of how computers evolved from their humble beginnings to
            the machines of today that surf the Internet, play games and stream multimedia in addition to crunching
            numbers.</small></p>

        <p><small>In France, Joseph Marie Jacquard invents a loom that uses punched wooden cards to automatically weave
            fabric designs. Early computers would use similar punch cards.</small></p>

        <p><small>English mathematician Charles Babbage conceives of a steam-driven calculating machine that would be
            able to compute tables of numbers. The project, funded by the English government, is a failure. More than a
            century later, however, the world's first computer was actually built.</small></p>

        <p><small>Herman Hollerith designs a punch card system to calculate the 1880 census, accomplishing the task in
            just three years and saving the government $5 million. He establishes a company that would ultimately become

        <p><small>Alan Turing presents the notion of a universal machine, later called the Turing machine, capable of
            computing anything that is computable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on his

            Defense Sciences Office, said in a statement. "Millions of molecules exist, and each molecule has a unique
            three-dimensional atomic structure as well as variables such as shape, size, or even color. This richness
            provides a vast design space for exploring novel and multi-value ways to encode and process data beyond the
            0s and 1s of current logic-based, digital architectures."</small>
